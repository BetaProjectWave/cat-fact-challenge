# Interview Challenge - Cat Facts API

We would like you to write an application that provides a RESTful API onto third party data.

We have provided a core skeleton for a Java Spring Boot application. You are asked to use an external API that provides facts about cats. Documentation on the API can be found at: https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/docs/ and the main API you will need to use is https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts

We would like you to complete this application with the following requirements:

* Allow a caller to retrieve a random fact about a cat.
* Allow a caller to query for all cat facts uploaded by a given user.
* Allow a caller to query for all cat facts in order of most upvoted, identifying the upvoters by name.

Stretch goal:

* Enable a caller to do a free text search across the fact library.

You are free to add additional functionality in addition to the above if you so wish.

We would also like you to consider the following:

* How might you deploy the application
* How you might optimize the application for performance
* How might you secure the API
* How you might extend the application in the future.

You may tackle the problem in any suitable development environment. If you so wish, you can tackle the problem using a different language or framework. 

This challenge is intended to be completed by candidates of all levels and experience, so you should attempt to complete as much as you feel demonstrates your capability. There is no expectation that all candidates will be able to complete all parts of this challenge. There is no time limit, but time taken may be taken into consideration during assessment.
